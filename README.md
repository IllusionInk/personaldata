# DearData - Cycling

> The aim is to generate a layered information visualization based on an aspect from our personal life.  The following repo contains a collated dataset of my cycling rides. The data was gathered from Strava's web app (an app used heavily by cyclists to track several parameters of their ride). 

### Dataset 
The list below describes the variables and their description in the dataset. While some of these variablse are obtained from the web/mobile app, others are personal annotations to add a layer of qualitative description.
